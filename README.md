# hello-world

Hello Githubers! 

To anyone who actually opens this repository.. I'm beginning my career in CS as of Jan 17' at Florida International University. I'm coming in for my second bachelors and excited to learn as much as possible. I will take all the help and tutoring I can get. Mostly looking for tutorials and great teachers!
